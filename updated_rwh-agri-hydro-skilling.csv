1002,Rainwater_Harvesting,"A brief look at the historical development of traditional rainwater harvesting systems of India ans also issues, need and relevance of RWH in the urban context The document informs that traditionally Indians worshipped both water and rain as “Jala” and “Varuna”. Even rivers were worshipped. Till 3000 B.C., RWH happened without human effort as rain got collected in rivers and natural depressions. Civilizations flourished on river banks all over the world Indus valley civilization in India. From 3000 B.C. to 1800 A.D., RWH happened with human effort. Indians harvested rainwater using different methods. These methods depended on local conditions. However, Since 1800 A.D. traditional systems of RWH began to deteriorate. The reasons included: Lack of understanding of these systems by the British during their rule till 1947 British wanted to be the provider of water and took over the management and ownership of water bodies. This attitude continued by our Indian rulers even after independence – 1947. Increase in urbanization lead to destruction of water bodies. Lack of awareness and apathetic attitude of urbanites The urban context Unlike in the past, present day urbanization has resulted both in shrinking of open spaces and very minimal area remaining unpaved. This has ultimately resulted not only in flooding of cities but has also caused water scarcity due to groundwater depletion in general and saline intrusion in coastal cities. Urban rainwater harvesting, due to lack of open space for capturing the runoff, is mostly in sub-soil storage as groundwater by injecting large amounts of rainwater into the soil during rains. RWH in urban areas also consists in reviving whatever water bodies that are left behind without allowing any further construction in them in future. This will be an activity at the macro level and will have to be undertaken by the government. At the micro level every resident/individual should implement both rooftop and driveway runoff harvesting in their respective homes, commercial complexes, office premises, factories etc. The article goes on to describe the step by step mechanisms to implement RWH at the microlevel."
1003,Rainwater_Harvesting,"This paper published in the Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge provides a brief overview of the the Ahar-Pyne system, a traditional water harvesting system still practised in the south Bihar plains of India and argues that these traditional water harvesting systems that have existed in India since a very long time are relevant or perhaps even more relevant in today's times and that there is an urgent need to revive these systems taking into consideration India's vulnerability to climatic changes and disasters and the increasing need for having sustainable water management systems in the future. The paper informs that there has been a growing attention to local management of common property resources and recognition of the potential of farmer managed irrigation systems. Many indigenous systems provide good examples of farmer management and are being studied for learning about the principles of management. However, these traditional water management systems are increasingly being replaced by the other faster means of groundwater extraction systems, which are less labour intensive for the farmers in the shorter run, but tend to be ecologically exploitative and unsustainable in the long run. The article goes on to describe the details of the Ahar-Pyne system and its evolution, an overview of the physical features of the state of Bihar and the current status of the system. The reasons for the success of the system in the past have been attributed to the following factors: Fragmented land holdings and equity in water distribution Cheap source of irrigation Uniformity in cropping Collective action The institutional and management issues in this system include: Equity in allocation and distribution of water Community participation and distribution of responsibilities Repair and maintenance Central control There has been a decline in the area irrigated by the ahars because of the following reasons: Abolition of the Zamindari system Development of new irrigation sources Lack of convergence between old and new systems The paper argues that even though the current picture indicates a gradual decline in the use of traditional water harvesting systems and they being replaced by modern techniques of surface and groundwater harvesting, it is very important and essential to revive these old systems as: There continue to be huge delays in the implementation of centralised major and medium irrigation projects, which need huge amounts of money and continue to be marred by technical, political and social gliches Traditional systems are easier to maintain in terms of cost and quality and the involvement of beneficiaries in repair and maintenance makes it sustainable in terms of quality and cost Traditional systems continue to be sustainable in the long run and minimise wastage The paper describes the current efforts being made in Bihar to revive these traditional systems and ends by arguing that urgent efforts need to be made to explore the possibility of revival of these sytems through: Encouraging more research on traditional water management systems by experts Converging these systems with various government programmes Encouraging people's participation and collective action for use and revival of"

1006,Rainwater_Harvesting,"The Veera Narayana temple of Gadag, Karnataka is well known to lakhs of people. Kumara Vyasa, it is told, wrote the great epic Mahabharatha in poetry form, sitting inside this temple. The temple is located in the town of Gadag, which is also the headquarters of Gadag district.The historical temple is making history again. From many years, water in the open well of this temple was saline. So much so that, if copper vessels were washed with this water, they would turn black. Not surprisingly, water was being pumped from a bore well for all the uses at the temple. In earlier years, there used to be some water in the well, but nobody was using it for any purpose. Due to declining water table, it turned almost empty since the last 12 years. By the end of summer, it used to dry completely. In the meantime, the first bore well was dug here about a decade ago. Within years, it dried up. Then they had to go for another. This way, the temple dug four bore-wells in a decade! Only one has water now. This water is used as naivedya, theerth and for cooking purposes now. Fortunately however, there was no move to fill the well up. Thanks to rain water harvesting, the same open well has started serving people round the year again. Not only has the quantity, but the quality of water also improved. Though the temple authorities haven't got it tested, for a layman it appears quite potable. Points out Prahlad Acharya, Temple Manager, ""Unlike long ago, now dal cooks very fast in this water."" Gadag district rarely gets its annual average rainfall of 750 mms. There is severe water scarcity in many parts of the district. This success should be an eye-opener to the drought-hit villagers who are ignorant about rainwater harvesting. It was in 2005 summer that under the 'food for work' scheme of the District Panchayat a big percolation pit was dug near the open well. The horticulture department also offered guidance for the work. The pit was ready before that year's monsoon began. The pit is 12 feet long, eight feet wide and has a depth of six feet. Except for two feet, the entire well is filled with filter media like blue metal. For readers who are wondering, blue metal is called 'jally' in local parlance, and is also used while tarring the road. Generally, two sizes of jally are used, one larger than the other. In percolation pits, lowest layer is of bigger jally; middle layer is of smaller jally. The topmost layer is of sand. It is sand that actually filters the run-off. The bottom layers of jally gives lot of air-space for the water for faster percolation into the sub-soil. The temple premises cover an area of 9,000 square feet. Two years ago, the whole area was covered by stones. Till then, all the rainwater that had fallen on the ground used to run away. After laying of"

1008,Rainwater_Harvesting,"These two case studies describe a study that explored the hydrological impacts of rainwater harvesting in the Arvari river catchment in Rajasthan.Part 1 looks at the field scale impacts and reports the results of a 2-year field study in the 476 km2 semi-arid Arvari River catchment, in Rajasthan, where over 366 RWH structures have been built since 1985. Rainwater harvesting (RWH), the small-scale collection and storage of runoff to augment groundwater stores, has been seen as a solution to the deepening groundwater crisis in India. However, hydrological impacts of RWH in India are not well understood, particularly at the larger catchment-scale. A key element to grasping RWH impact involves understanding the generated recharge variability in time and space, which is the result of variability in rainfall-runoff and efficiency of RWH structures. There are very few reported empirical studies of the impact of RWH. Catchment-scale impacts are best studied using a water balance model, which would require a basic level of field data and understanding of the variability. As a part of this study, potential recharge estimates from seven RWH storages, across three different types and in six landscape positions, were calculated using the water balance method. These estimates were compared with recharge estimates from monitored water levels in 29 dug wells using the water table fluctuation method. The average daily potential recharge from RWH structures varied between 12 and 52 mm/day, while estimated actual recharge reaching the groundwater ranged from 3 to 7 mm/day. The large difference between recharge estimates could be explained through soil storage, local groundwater mounding beneath structures and a large lateral transmissivity in the aquifer. Overall, approximately 7% of rainfall was recharged by RWH in the catchment, which was similar in the comparatively wet and dry years of the field analysis. There were key differences between RWH structures, due to engineering design and location. These results indicate that recharge from RWH affects the local groundwater table, but also has potential to move laterally and impact surrounding areas. Part 2 looks at catchment scale impacts. A conceptual water balance model, based on field data from the Arvari River catchment, was developed to study and understand catchment-scale trade-offs of rainwater harvesting (RWH). The model incorporated an effective representation of RWH function and impact, and worked on a daily time step. Catchment spatial variability was captured through sub-basins. Within each sub-basin, hydrological response units (HRUs) described the different land use/soil combinations associated with the case study catchment, including irrigated agriculture. Sustainability indices, based on irrigated agriculture water demand, were used to compare conceptual management scenarios. The results showed that as RWH area increased, it reached a limiting capacity from where additional RWH structures did not increase the benefit to groundwater stores, but reduced stream flow. If the irrigation area was increased at the optimal level of RWH, where the sustainability indices were greatest, the resilience of the system actually decreased. Nevertheless, RWH in a system increased the overall sustainability of the water resource for irrigated agriculture, compared to a"
1009,Rainwater_Harvesting,"Self reliance in water, a practical manual for city and town dwellers by Indukanth Ragade, describes the what, why and how of the paths towards self-reliance in water.Every one of us, would love to have ready access to good quality water in adequate quantity to meet our daily needs. Paradoxically, in spite of all the technological progress the country has made in the many decades since independence, ready access to good water for our daily needs is yet to become a reality in most of our cities, towns as well as villages. In thousands of villages, women still have to walk long distances daily to collect potable water. In cities and towns, groundwater levels are falling and potable water is increasingly being purchased. While the powers that be have taken various steps in these 57 years, their impact at the individual household level has been none too encouraging. Therefore it is important that we citizens should strive, in our own selfish interest, to alter this sad state of affairs. And we can make a difference if only we put in efforts at the micro level - at the individual level, at the household level, at the neighbourhood level and at the community level - to reduce our dependence for water on external sources. The tremendous advantage in acting at the micro-level is that we have the maximum control and influence on any activity undertaken by ourselves and we can therefore be that much surer of achieving results and reaping benefits of our efforts. Three steps to self-reliance in water And what are these efforts that can confer on us - town and city dwellers - that vital self-reliance in our daily water needs ? In essence, they are three fold: 1. Harvesting rainwater Unlike many other areas in the world, our country is very fortunate in that it receives substantial rainfall from its two monsoons. If only this rainfall is tapped, can it meet fully our most essential daily need, i.e. water for our cooking and drinking needs, in every town and city - even in areas where the annual rainfall in scanty. And what is more, it can meet from 20% to 100% of the total water needs of practically all towns and cities, depending on the rainfall in that place and its population.i.e. tapping rainwater wherever and whenever it falls, and diverting it to an appropriate storage for our use later. 2. Purifying used water and putting it back for reuse The water that we use for bathing, washing of clothes and cleaning the floors constitutes 50-60% of our total daily water usage. If only we clean this slightly contaminated water used for these purposes, it becomes available for fresh use again. 3. Conserving the water available for our daily use Knowingly or unknowingly, we use water wastefully in our daily activities. Conservation of water is nothing but realising the value of water and adopting simple techniques of using available water more efficiently for various uses in daily"
1010,Rainwater_Harvesting,"Chhattisgarh ranked number 1 in the country for providing domestic water connections in 2014-15 under the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). Despite this, the government has failed to provide safe and clean drinking water to many who are still affected by fluoride, arsenic and iron contamination. 17 out of 27 districts, which includes 592 villages, show fluorosis as one of the major public health problems. 1700 government schools in Chhattisgarh don't even have basic water facilities in the villages, which is ironic given that ""Chhattisgarh receives an average rainfall of 1200 mm, but does not harvest even 10 percent of the rooftop water for drinking purposes"", says Paras Yadav, a trained hydrologist working with Samerth, an NGO working on water and other social issues in the state. Rooftop rainwater harvesting is the technique through which rainwater is captured from the roof and stored for use later. Harvested rainwater can be stored in sub-surface groundwater reservoirs or in storage tanks. Advantages of using rooftop rainwater harvesting Provides self-sufficiency to water supply. Reduces the cost of pumping groundwater. Provides high-quality water that is soft and low in minerals. Improves the quality of groundwater through dilution when recharged to the ground. Reduces soil erosion in urban and rural areas. Is a cost-effective and simple technique. RWH structures easy to construct, operate and maintain. In saline or coastal areas rainwater provides good quality water, and when recharged to the ground, it reduces salinity and also helps in maintaining the balance between the fresh-saline water interface. In Islands, due to the limited extent of freshwater aquifers, rainwater harvesting is the most preferred source of water for domestic use. Rooftop rainwater harvesting in Chhattisgarh A rooftop rainwater harvesting model was constructed by Samerth at Madiya Kachar village in Bilaspur district to combat the contaminated water that the community, which was predominantly the Baiga tribe, had access to. The model structure had a capacity of 66,000 litres and was set up at the primary school building at Madiya Kachar. The school was chosen for the following reasons: It had a flat roof that could capture maximum rainwater. The number of school going children at Madiya Kachar was higher than those at nearby schools. Iron contamination was highest in the village. The dropout rate of school going children was rising rapidly due to the non-availability of drinking water within the school premises. The drinking water source was 1km away from the school building. A village committee was formed and the school and Aanganwadi staff were trained in order to maintain and monitor this rainwater harvesting structure. ""Implementation of rooftop rainwater harvesting at the household level is not possible right now in rural areas because most of the houses at Madiya Kachar have earthen roofing tiles that require high maintenance and monitoring"", says Suvigya Pathak, Senior Programme Coordinator, Samert, Chhattisgarh. The villagers now have access to clean and safe drinking water, and are also not dealing as much with scarcity. Neighbouring villages are trying to replicate this model"

1021,Agriculture,"IoT in the agri-food supply chain helps measure and monitor sustainability indicators like crop productivity, fertiliser usage, and water efficiency Agricultural developments have played a pivotal role in the emergence of sedentary human civilisation. The agri-food sector remains crucial globally, yet conventional farming methods persist. Information and Communication Technology (ICT), with advancements like Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data Analytics (BDA), and Cloud computing, have significantly transformed agriculture. These technologies aim to promote sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, enhancing nutrition, and improving agricultural efficiency to meet the growing food demand, especially with the projected global population of 9.6 billion by 2050. IoT has emerged as a game-changer in agriculture, enabling control over robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and irrigation systems. It also aids in forecasting through classical and machine learning models, tracing the supply chain, and monitoring environmental, facility, machinery, weather, water, soil, and crop conditions. IoT platforms enhance sustainability, logistics, cold chain management, governance, collaboration, and risk mitigation, offering better connectivity, reduced human intervention, and improved energy management. However, IoT faces challenges in technology, society, and organisation, including decentralisation, privacy, security, data governance, internet availability, interoperability, and managing big data. Social challenges involve societal acceptance, technical skills, and legislation, while organizational challenges include trust, initial investment, return on investment, and heterogeneity. Despite the significance of IoT in agriculture, few studies have explored the influence of more than five critical factors on its adoption. Additionally, much of the existing literature overlooks these factors, signaling a research gap. Furthermore, previous research primarily focused on technical challenges during implementation, with limited attention to social, economic, and organizational factors affecting IoT adoption. To address these gaps, this study ‘Unlocking adoption challenges of IoT in Indian Agricultural and Food Supply Chain’ by Narwane et al aims to answer the following research questions: What are the critical factors of IoT adoption in the agri-food supply chain, particularly in emerging economies? What are the interrelationships between these critical factors? What are the most significant factors and how do they rank in importance? What steps should be taken to facilitate effective IoT adoption in the agri-food supply chain? So, IoT offers immense potential for the agricultural sector, but its adoption is hindered by various challenges. Addressing these challenges and understanding the critical factors is essential for harnessing IoT's capabilities to ensure a sustainable and productive future for the agri-food industry, particularly in emerging economies. IoT for agriculture and food sector IoT in the agri-food sector encompasses various functions such as greenhouse cultivation, precision agriculture, and machinery automation. It enables controlled plant growth in greenhouses through wireless sensor networks, enhancing efficiency and reducing human intervention. Precision agriculture employs data sensing via IoT sensors to control variables like labour, equipment, crop maturity, air and soil quality, and weather. IoT-enabled machinery operates autonomously, reducing losses and improving productivity. Tracing and tracking of agri-food products using technologies like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) provide product history visibility. IoT is also used for monitoring livestock farming, forestry, aquaponics,"
1022,Agriculture,"ndia has made impressive progress in rural electrification (RE) since the government of India shifted its policy focus towards universal household electrification since early 2000s. However, evidence suggests limited impacts on household incomes and expenditures since agriculture still drives the economy and electricity is primarily used for generating income through pumping groundwater for irrigation - one of the important factors affecting prosperity among small holder farmers informs this paper titled 'The changing impact of rural electrification on Indian agriculture' published in Nature Communications. To make India self sufficient in grain production, it was realised that reliable and steady sources of irrigation were necessary for the success of the Green Revolution (GR). Regions that enjoyed GR-led increases in agricultural production had highly politicised agrarian lobbies who demanded better and cheaper resources to increase agricultural production. Thus, agricultural electricity coverage was increased in these states and electricity rates were also subsidised. Electricity for agricultural use was given more importance as compared to household electrification. By the early 1990s, the focus on grain production was reduced and thus rural electrification (RE) lagged behind in states which had lost out on GR-driven demand for electricity. The second wave of RE focused on domestic electrification in the early 2000s. The Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) launched in 2005, provided 90 percent grant-based financing to states for universal household electrification and free electricity connections for households below the poverty line. States were granted funding by the central government based on the number of rural households that needed electricity connections and prescribed electricity loads per household. Thus while RGGVY has led to rapid expansion of RE in India, but while it has been relatively successful in bridging the regional gap in household electrification, large regional differences still remain in electrified pumping of groundwater. The latest government numbers indicate near universal household electrification. However, very little information is available on the short-term or long-term impacts of RGGVY on rural economy and agriculture in India. This paper discusses the findings of a study that examines the consequences of this imbalance in rural electrification policy on agricultural development in India. Agriculture and groundwater irrigation in India Agriculture employs over 70 percent of the country’s rural working population and a large majority of small holder farmers depend on irrigation through pumping of groundwater because of its relatively low variable cost of extraction (provided the presence of electricity infrastructure) and individual accessibility. Groundwater can be accessed during dry cultivation months (the Rabi season) when surface water flow is diminished, making it an effective source of irrigation. Additionally, wells also give farmers independence, as it relieves them from the competing uses of hydropower generation and riparian rights like canals. Groundwater extraction in India has been increasing with increase in the number of deep tube-wells with depths greater than 70m, which require submersible pump-sets that run on electricity. Even shallow wells now use electricity for pumping as diesel is now more expensive than agricultural electricity in most Indian states. Hence it is used"
1023,Agriculture,"Challenging gender and caste identities: The women wheat farmers of Madhya Pradesh This study finds that gender plays a far more important role than caste in structuring “who decides"" among the men and women wheat farmers in Madhya Pradesh. However, women have now begun to challenge gendered caste structures that restrict them to unpaid agricultural work. Feminisation of agricultural labour in India India is experiencing masculinisation of labour and while the labour force participation rate (LFPR) of men is increasing, that of women is decreasing. However, the only exception to this pattern is in agriculture. In many parts of India, women provide labour across all productive and post-harvest farm tasks, regardless of caste and work on family fields and as hired labourers on other farms informs this paper titled 'Caste-gender intersectionalities in wheat-growing communities in Madhya Pradesh, India' published in Gender, Technology and Development'. For example, in 1981, two-thirds of men (66.3 percent) and four-fifths (82.6 percent) of women worked in agriculture while this has grown to (49.8 percent) for men and (65 percent) for women by 2011. SC and ST women dominate the rural labour force. In 2011, 83.7 percent of ST women, 69.1 percent of SC women, and 59.9 percent of non marginalised castes (NMC) women were working in agriculture. However, women are being less involved in paid labour across the caste hierarchy and are more likely than men to be engaged in manual labour and to be paid less than men for the same work. Agriculture is getting more and more mechanised and affecting women’s and men’s work in different ways. The type of crops also affect work patterns of men and women. For example, some crops are more male- or female-dominant with respect to the gender division of labour and can influence men’s or women’s work. Role of women in wheat based farming systems in Madhya Pradesh The paper discusses the findings of a study that explores the role of women in the wheat based farming systems in a rural village in Jabalpur district in Madhya Pradesh. It aims at answering the following questions: Is decision-making and labour in wheat farming feminised? In what ways do interactions between caste and gender determine and limit the spaces within which women can act in wheat-based systems? In what ways are women challenging their gender and caste identities to enhance their livelihoods by influencing their roles, responsibilities and decision-making in wheat? The study was carried out in a rural village with 250 households in Madhya Pradesh. Most people from the village belong to the Other Socially marginalised Castes (OSMC), ST, and SC categories with just six resident NMC families. Jabalpur, the district capital, is about 30 kilometers distant. The primary crops grown in the village include wheat, rice, pulses, and some vegetables. Large farmers comprise 2 percent, small farmers 60 percent, and the rest are marginal farmers. Majority of the people in the village own around around 1.5 acres of land. NMC and OSMC manage the land on one"
1024,Agriculture,"Policy and implementation gaps in reaching women farmers with climate-smart agriculture practices In India, more than half of the net sown area is rainfed during the monsoon season, which runs from June to September. Climate change affects farming practices, which affects the crucial kharif crop and jeopardises food security. It also affects the monsoon onset in central and northern India. Crops are at risk from delayed monsoons, which increase pest populations and cause flooding even though they don't lower overall rainfall. Farmers adjust their practices in response to climate change, placing additional strain on the ecosystem and escalating food insecurity. Small farm households, which make up 86% of all farm households, are particularly vulnerable to these disparities. In India, the agricultural sector accounts for 16.2% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. A suggested strategy that prioritises reducing poverty and ensuring food security is climate-smart agriculture (FAO, 2013). Climate-smart agriculture adoption is low despite potential benefits, particularly for women and smallholder farmers (Mallappa and Pathak, 2023; Aryal et al., 2018). The paper ""Gender, agriculture policies, and climate-smart agriculture in India"" looks at gendered adoption and preferences for climate-smart agriculture in India while addressing information access barriers. The study includes in-depth interviews with Gujarat farmers, allowing climate-smart agriculture interpretation to be flexible in order to capture regional difficulties. The goal of the study is to improve knowledge of climate-smart agriculture adoption in light of climate change threats, with a focus on women farmers. Methods and data The review of the literature examined the development of climate-smart agriculture, looked at Indian and global policy priorities, and assessed how well India was implementing climate-smart agriculture. This provided guidance for the subsequent data collection, which focused on national and state-level policies and programs and involved journals, book chapters, and easily accessible grey literature. Gujarat is a major agricultural state with a varied climate. Recent warming trends and an increase in extreme rainfall events have affected productivity, particularly in areas that are prone to drought. The study conducted 22 focus group discussions (FGDs) with 245 men and women farmers in nine districts to address these issues and promote sustainable agriculture. The discussions provided insights into gendered roles, perceptions of climate change, adaptive strategies, and information sources. The cooperative study emphasises how critical it is to comprehend farmers' viewpoints in order to design focused interventions in the face of climate change. Climate-smart agriculture in India: Understanding the policy context, adoption, and access to extension services through a gender lens The definition and application of climate-smart agriculture practices, which seek to promote sustainable growth, increased income, and climate resilience, are up for debate. Resource disparities among farmers are emphasised by critics, who call for a variety of policies. There are still disagreements about the role of mitigation in low- and middle-income nations, as well as the viability of combining mitigation goals with sustainability and productivity. La Via Campesina and other agrarian movement’s view climate-smart agriculture as a corporate front, and they worry that it will increase the vulnerabilities"
1025,Agriculture,"There is a need for a comprehensive strategy, including robust policies, effective budget allocation, and grassroots empowerment, to ensure sustainable water resource management and agricultural productivity in India. Our needs are numerous, with food, clothing, and shelter being our basic requirements. Ensuring basic food security is paramount for any country, as relying on others for our survival is quite risky. Fortunately, rice and wheat are the two prominent staple food crops that are widely and abundantly grown in India to feed the masses. Cotton, a fiber crop, is extensively used in the textile industry, along with other synthetic fibers. Sugarcane is also cultivated across the country, as sugar is a daily requirement in our diet. India is a vast and diverse country with 15 Agroclimatic Zones, further divided into 72 sub-zones. Our varied geographic and climatic conditions enable us to grow a wide range of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, spices, fiber crops, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and other commercial crops. The arable land covers 165.67 million hectares, the highest in the world. Almost 50% of our land is arable, which is significantly higher compared to only 17% in the USA and 7% in Russia. The USA is the close second in terms of area under arable land, followed by Russia. Focus needed on crops with high water demand Although we take pride in achieving self-sufficiency in food, primarily due to advancements during the Green Revolution, the uncertainties of monsoons and the changing climate pose a threat to our ongoing success. To ensure resilience in agriculture, it is crucial to comprehend the gravity of the situation and implement corrective measures. Effective management of water and soil, the two key ingredients for crop production, is essential to sustain our crop outputs in the years to come. Crop water management is crucial in agriculture, especially in rice, wheat, sugarcane and cotton since they take away almost 90% of our irrigation water and occupy 46% of the gross cropped area. There is tremendous scope to improve water use efficiency (WUE) since it is only around 38% in India compared to around 60% in the developed countries. The physical water productivity is also low in major crops in India compared to the developed world. A 5% increase in water productivity in rice would save around 11 BCM of water which is huge while the National Water Mission has set a 20% increase in water use efficiency as one of its goals. Our strength: Network of public institutions and programmes The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India has framed several policies and programmes for increasing crop productivity and water use efficiency to enhance farm income on a sustainable basis. National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) for promoting organic farming, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) for accelerating the adoption of micro-irrigation, PM PRANAM Scheme for reducing the use of chemical fertilizers are some of the efforts in that direction. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has over 100 Institutions with multiple centres spread across the"
1026,Agriculture,"The report presents six case studies on how sustainable agriculture programmes scaled up in the past in India The agrarian complexities India faces are large-scale and systemic, intertwined with socio-economic and environmental issues. It’s been decades since the Green Revolution, and India’s agricultural systems are facing a crisis resulting from high input costs, deteriorating soil health, continued debt cycles, inequitable market access, and lack of financial security, specifically affecting the small and medium farmers (Dutta 2012; Reddy and Mishra 2010). The crisis is compounded by extreme climate events—droughts, floods, untimely rains, and desert locusts—which have harshly impacted farmers across the country (Gupta et al. 2021). The agrarian crisis has become acute because sustainable agricultural practices and systems (SAPSs) are not widely practiced. Only five SAPSs—crop rotation, agroforestry, rainwater harvesting, mulching, and precision—have scaled up beyond five per cent of the net sown area (ibid). As the challenges we face are large-scale and systemic, intertwined with socio-economic and environmental issues, high-impact and scalable solutions are needed to counter them. A recent report ‘How to Design Scalable and Sustainable Programmes: Framework for India’s Sustainable Agriculture Initiatives’ by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water presents a scalability framework, a non-prescriptive tool for designing, implementing, and evaluating scalable programs for sustainable agriculture. The framework provides a set of outcomes that, when fulfilled, help a project achieve scale. These outcomes are communicated in the form of key success factors for scalability. The key factors are useful for a range of stakeholders such as NGOs, government departments, corporates, development financiers, and community-based organizations, among others. Need for a scalability framework for agricultural projects Sustainable growth and scalable impact are part of the Indian government’s agenda for its G20 presidency in 2023, with agriculture being one of key focus areas. Mission LiFE, a mass movement for individual and community-led scalable actions for sustainable production and consumption, was already launched in the country in 2022. At the Government of India’s urging, the United Nations declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets (IYM). India is also the chair of IYM’s Steering Committee, with a mandate to scale up millet production among UN member nations. In the light of such fierce ambitions and timely calls for action, practitioners need to design scalable programmes to make a sizeable impact and bring the required systemic shifts. This report answers the question, “What are the factors that ensure the scalability of a programme?” Many innovative solutions and projects operate in India. Only those with a high degree of an understanding of and access to social and human capital, financial resources, and government support scale up as we have explained in this report. Existing scalability literature rarely draws from the Indian experience and hence not useful to practitioners or programme implementers. Therefore, actors such as non-governmental organisations (NGOs), government departments, corporates, development financiers, and community-based organisations will benefit from this scalability framework that extracts learning from successfully scaled up programmes for sustainable agriculture in India. How to design a scalable programme? The"
1027,Agriculture,"How has the collective action model piloted in rural women of Odisha helped empower farm women? Women play a crucial role in agriculture in India Women play an important role in agriculture besides contributing to household food and nutrition security and account for as high as 80 percent of the farm work in India. Women toil hard in the fields and perform multiple activities ranging from land preparation, seed selection and treatment, sowing, transplanting, weeding, fertilisation harvesting, threshing, winnowing including key post-harvest activities such as processing and storage. Absence of land titles disempowers and invisibilises women However, despite their significant contribution to agriculture, women’s access to resources is much less than men, especially in terms of land ownership informs this paper titled 'Empowering women farmers through collective action: a case study of Khanizpur Hamlet, Odisha' published in Gender, Technology and Development. Thus, while more and more women are managing and engaging with family farms, it has not translated into a rise in land ownership among women and women engage in agriculture either as tenant cultivators on others’ land or as agricultural labourers on their family farm. The agriculture census (2011) defines a farmer as the “operational holder” or someone who has responsibility for the agricultural land and land is a state subject and state governments consider only people with a land title as farmers. The census (2011) calls anyone who operates a piece of agricultural land a “cultivator”. Thus, 3.6 crore women without land titles who engage in agriculture are classified as mere “cultivators” and not farmers. Thus most women in agriculture, including tenant farmers, cannot make use of the governmental schemes meant for farmers, access institutional credit for farming or qualify to receive subsidies. Apart from a land title, small landholdings coupled with limited access to productive resources such as credit, inputs such as water, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds, extension services, transportation, storage, technical assistance besides lack bargaining power in input and output markets because of their farm size prevents women farmers from adopting new technologies or selling their produce. Women farmers are thus forced to borrow at a high rate of interest and purchase inputs such as fertiliser, pesticide, and seeds at market price. When operating as a tenant cultivator, they are denied access to government procurement centers as they cannot furnish the required documents (such as land ownership documents or sharecropper certificates from landowners) to register their names for sale of their produce. Sharecropping is the most commonly used land tenure contract by small or marginal farmers who cannot afford to buy land in which a tenant cultivates the land for the landowner and the output is shared on some pre-determined basis. The output share ranges from 25% to 50% for the landlord Marginal farmers are forced to put all their available resources such as human and animal resoirces to use with the hope of increasing their total harvest and farm income. However, if the crop fails, then the landowner receives the government compensation, not the tenant farmers."
1028,Agriculture,"While most post independence reforms have encouraged agricultural landownership among rural women as daughters, what exists in actual practice? A study explores. It is now widely recognised among policymakers and practitioners that women’s ownership of agricultural land is an important determinant of their economic and social status, physical security, and the wellbeing of their family informs this paper titled 'How many and which women own land in India? Inter-gender and intra-gender gaps' published in The Journal of Development Studies. Equal land rights for women is also a key target of Goal 5 on gender equality in the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Very little information exists on land ownership among women However, many countries such as India lack comprehensive country-wide estimates of the gender inequality in land ownership. Most studies focus on indicators such as percentage of women owning land or what percentage of landowners are female. However, there is a lack of studies that look at different aspects of inequality such as details of individual vs. joint ownership, and the proportion, area and quality of land owned. Although women can acquire land by various means, such as inheritance, gift, purchase, or government transfers, inheritance is usually the most important mode in in South Asia via which women acquire agricultural land which is largely owned privately, as women are more financially constrained than men in their ability to purchase any. All the post-Independence reforms have focused on strengthening women’s rights as daughters rather than their rights as widows or wives and on encouraging women to acquire land as daughters, especially as coparceners in joint family property. However very little information is available on whether this exists in reality. This paper discusses the findings of a study that assesses the parameters of rural women’s land ownership across nine states, and changes in the same set of households over a five-year period, 2010–2014, for all the surveyed states, and over 2009–2014 for five states. The study finds that: Barely 14 percent of women are landowners owning 11 percent of agricultural land in rural landowning households, averaged across states. In 2014, women owned land in only 16 percent of the households across regions (8 percent of these households also had male owners, while 84 percent had no female owners at all). The highest percentage of households with female landowners is in Telangana (44 percent) and the lowest was in Odisha (6 percent) while that for men were 82 percent and 98 percent respectively. Thus, nine years after the enactment of the HSAA 2005, and over time (2010–2014), there has only been a slight upward trend in several states, but the change is small, and some states, such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat remain nearly flat or even show a slight decline. Female landowners form only 14 percent of all landowners with the south doing better than the rest of India. In 2014, 23 percent of all landowners in south India were women as compared to 10 percent in west and central"
1029,Agriculture,"Agriculture is the largest livelihood provider in India and in the years following the green revolution, the focus has shifted from food grains to horticultural crops, which include fruits and vegetables. Growing vegetables in the Uttarakhand hills remains an unorganised activity and farmers still rely on traditional methods, and are not as familiar with the current extension system as the farmers cultivating food grains in other parts of the country are. Growing vegetables can be a financially lucrative technique that could replace subsistence farming in the hills. Most of the vegetable growers in the Himalayan states like Uttarakhand are small and marginal farmers and while the agro-climatic and soil conditions of Uttarakhand are favourable for the production of vegetables, vegetable growers need timely information, advice, inputs and resources to grow more produce and gain maximum profit. Women farmers form an important section of the workforce for vegetable growing in Uttarakhand, but they continue to lack access to information due to the lack of identity of women as farmers and restricted access to information providers and technology. Barriers in the societal, economic, legal and, in some cases, educational spheres limit the access of women to these services . Thus, understanding the structural organisation of the social network of smallholder farmers is crucial in order to improve their access to information. This paper titled 'Do the information networks of farmers differ across gender? Evidence from the hills of Uttarakhand, India using social network analysis' published in Current Science aims at identifying the dominant information networks accessed by men and women farmers to improve their agricultural practices and the factors affecting information network usage among male and female vegetable growers in Uttarakhand in the Indian Himalayas. The study found that: Information networks of vegetable growers varied across gender Local, interpersonal sources of information were popular among women farmers as they chose relatives/family members, neighbours/friends and group members as their most preferred information sources. Men farmers preferred more formal interpersonal information sources and they derived most of their information from the State Horticulture Department, followed by progressive farmers and shopkeepers/input dealers. Both male and female farmers chose mobile phones with the internet over television as the most preferred mass media. The network of female farmers was less dense than that of male farmers, while the communication network among males was relatively more efficient than females. Informal sources of information, such as family members, followed by neighbours and friends, and group members limited spread of information among women. In the case of male farmers, formal sources such as the State Horticulture Department, progressive farmers, dealers and shopkeepers helped in spreading information quickly and had significant influence over the flow of information in the network. Factors affecting information networks usage by female vegetable growers Factors such as education, farming experience, time dedicated to farming, group membership and contact with extension agencies influenced information networks among men and women. Women farmers Being a member of self-help groups, commodity interest groups, etc. had a positive and significant relation,"
1030,Agriculture,"Unexpected weather conditions and changing rainfall pattern have been noticed all over the world especially in last few years. These events upset the calculations of farmers thus affecting the normal sowing and harvesting cycle of crops which leads to lower yields. To deal with this scenario, not only the farmers need to take to weather-resilient crops, government also needs to equip them with appropriate information. Strengthening climate risk information and tools should be accorded top priority to minimise crop losses on account of disasters. Weather forecast should be prepared at block level with village level outreach.Promotion of weather-resistant crop varieties like flood and salinity resistant rice and drought-resistant pulses should be promoted and further improved. Likewise short-cycle crops of particular region which can withstand heat and ripen before heavy rains should be given due recognition. Narendra 97 is a good example of a short cycle paddy crop grown in Uttar Pradesh that can deal with intense heat and ripens in a shorter period than the commonly cultivated paddy. It has proven effective in flood prone areas. Millets, one of the major grains of Indian landscape, have been pushed back because of preference given to wheat and rice. However, these coarse grains are known to grow in hard conditions and are our best bet against climate change. A compilation of such crops should be created, disseminated and field-tested in different parts of the country.Mixed cropping like growing paddy with pulses, millets and vegetables should be promoted to ensure food security in case one of the crops fail due to drought or floods."
1031,Agriculture,"Worldwide, soil degradation could cost $23 million by 2050 due to the loss of food, ecosystem services, and income. Soil health in agriculture is critical, with near-term impacts likely. As an agricultural innovator, Corteva is built on a believes in promoting sustainable agriculture and providing farmers with the most suitable and effective solutions to protect the health of their soil. According to a 2022 report by FAO, soil has been declared finite by the United Nations, which predicts catastrophic soil loss within 60 years. Worldwide, soil degradation could cost $23 million by 2050 due to the loss of food, ecosystem services, and income. Soil health in agriculture is critical, with near-term impacts likely. Managing soil health allows farmers to work with the land – not against it – to reduce erosion, maximise water infiltration, improve nutrient cycling, save money on inputs, and ultimately improve the resiliency of their working land. Farmers play a central role in this aspect. Food production relies on healthy soils to produce high and healthy crop yields. Farmers play a key role in the uptake and development of solutions that increase soil health. As custodians of the land with a deep connection and understanding of the soil in which they farm, farmers are leading the charge in soil regeneration and are setting a precedent for the future of soil-friendly farming. As our understanding of the importance of soil health increases, farmers are implementing a range of different soil-focussed agricultural approaches which in turn increases their productivity and profitability. Maintaining soil health Crops draw nutrients from the soil through their roots. The roots, in turn, release food that sustains the beneficial organisms in the soil. This is how the soil food web works. However, roots are not immune to threats. A variety of factors can destroy roots. One of the least understood threats is harmful or bad nematodes, which are microscopic and invisible to the naked eye but have the power to ravage a crop and cause significant yield loss. Control of harmful nematodes is essential to keeping your crops healthy. Contrary to what many people think, the number of harmful or bad nematodes in the soil is easily outnumbered by the number of good or beneficial nematodes that promote natural fertility and quality over time. Beneficial nematodes feed on bacteria, fungi, insects, or bad nematodes in the soil, stimulating soil nutrient cycles, and keeping populations of damaging plant pests and diseases at bay. Therefore, it is crucial to adopt farm management tools that work in harmony with the beneficial nematodes. Management of nematodes is difficult The most reliable practices are preventive, including sanitation and choice of plant varieties. You can reduce existing infestations through fallowing, crop rotation, and soil solarization. However, these methods reduce nematodes primarily in the top foot or so of the soil, so they are effective only for about a year. They are suitable primarily for annual plants or to help young woody plants establish. Once nematodes infest an area or crop, try"
1032,Agriculture,"India briefly overtook China in agrifoodtech investment, while Southeast Asia demonstrated significant potential with $1.7 billion in funding As the world's largest region in both geography and population, with a vast network of smallholder farmers combined with dense urban settings and food sovereignty concerns, Asia-Pacific is a hotbed of opportunity for food and agriculture technology startups. But in 2023, downstream food delivery and restaurant startups, once the darling of the region’s agrifoodtech ecosystem, fueling tens of billions of dollars of investment, are no longer so attractive to investors. The new star of the ecosystem is upstream innovation, reveals a new report from leading agrifoodtech venture firm and research platform AgFunder, in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Omnivore and AgriFutures Australia. The report provides exclusive insights into the Asia-Pacific agtech landscape. In 2022, upstream agtech investment increased by 24%, surpassing downstream funding for the first time in years, benefiting smallholder farmers. India briefly overtook China in agrifoodtech investment, while Southeast Asia demonstrated significant potential with $1.7 billion in funding. Categories such as Ag Biotechnology and Innovative Food showed remarkable growth. The report also delves into stage-wise funding trends and highlights startups in key markets. While total funding to the farm-to-fork agrifoodtech ecosystem dropped 58% year-over-year (YoY) to $6.5 billion in 2022 from the record-breaking $15.2 billion raised in 2021, investment in startups operating upstream increased 24% YoY. This increase appears to be continuing in 2023, according to preliminary data on 2023 funding flows. This is good news for the 450 million smallholder farmers producing about 80% of the region's food. For the first time in years, upstream funding, which provides technologies to farmers and primary food producers, overtook downstream investment. The former raised $3.2 billion in 2022 versus the latter's $2.7 million, according to the report. The Ag Biotechnology category was particularly buoyant in the Asia-Pacific region in 2022, bringing in $813 million in funding, nearly half the amount raised globally in this category in 2022. While a couple of very large deals contributed to these totals, there was also greater deal activity in this segment, which includes on-farm inputs for crop & animal agriculture,"" confirming investors’ growing interest in this space. Innovative Food – the category housing the alternative protein industry – bucked the global decline in funding to the segment, with investment actually increasing year-over-year to $527 million, albeit over fewer deals. Similarly, Farm Management Software, Sensing & IoT ($334m), Farm Robotics ($252m) and Novel Farming Systems startups ($254m), which include indoor farming and aquaculture and insect farming, brought in more funding across fewer deals. China, meanwhile, lost its lead to India as the country attracting the most funding in 2022, likely due to the loss of downstream mega-deals that propped up China's agrifoodtech investment in 2021. India's lead looks to be short lived, however; in H1 2023, China grabbed the top spot back, raising $861 million.

1033,Agriculture,"Farmers' input, subsidies, incentives, and promotion through PDS could enhance the adoption of alternative cereals. Future policy framing should consider subsidies, irrigation efficiency, yield gap, and technological improvements. India is the second-largest cereal exporter globally, making its cereal production vital for both domestic and international food security. Three major states in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal - account for 30% of India's total food production and are considered the food bowl of India. The IGP is known for cultivating water-intensive rice and wheat, which together fulfill 63% of the country's calorie demand. However, this system relies heavily on irrigation, with 40% of water sourced from groundwater, further exacerbated by government electricity subsidies that encourage the inefficient use of water and energy. The overuse of groundwater resources in northern India has led to alarming declines in groundwater levels, with Punjab and Haryana witnessing severe depletion. Surprisingly, even the Ganga Basin, traditionally seen as a water surplus region, has been experiencing significant groundwater depletion in recent years. From 2002 to 2016, the Gangetic basin lost 227 ± 25 km3 of groundwater. Groundwater depletion due to agricultural intensification is a major threat to water and food security in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), a critical food bowl, home to 400 million people and currently producing 135 million metric tonnes of cereals. These declining groundwater levels have led to increased energy consumption for water extraction, raising the cost of cultivation and food prices, thereby impacting food security. Despite these widespread consequences, finding sustainable solutions for this unsustainable groundwater consumption remains a challenge due to the complexity of addressing food and water security, energy savings, farmers' profits, and environmental sustainability simultaneously. Resolving these issues necessitates considering potentially conflicting objectives across various domains, including water, food, and energy. While global studies have shown promise in optimising crop choices to enhance water and food security, local and regional contexts require specific considerations. In the case of the IGP, studies addressing water, food, and environmental sustainability have been limited. Recent India-specific research has shown that replacing rice and wheat with less water-intensive crops like millet and sorghum can boost food supply, conserve water and energy, and enhance environmental sustainability. However, these assessments often omit crucial factors, such as farmers' profits. Given the conflicting nature of various sustainability objectives, a multi-objective framework is essential to minimise trade-offs and identify cropping configurations that improve multiple outcomes. In this study ‘Crop switching for water sustainability in India’s food bowl yields co-benefits for food security and farmers’ profits’, the authors have developed and applied a crop switching optimisation model for cereals in the IGP to maximise calorie production and farmers’ profits and minimise water consumption. Trends in the use of groundwater, water levels, and net recharge were analysed in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal, which cover most of the IGP. To address these challenges, the researchers developed a multi-objective optimisation model that considers maximising calorie production, minimising irrigation water, and maximising farmers' profits."

Notices have been issued to Chief Secretaries of all States and the Secretary of the Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS). The 2021 order directed the establishment of functional Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs), and Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) to address gaps in sewage or effluent generation and treatment. The Ministry of Jal Shakti was tasked with devising a more effective monitoring mechanism for pollution control and river rejuvenation. The NGT emphasised mission-mode compliance with timelines. In response to an execution application, the NGT noted non-compliance by states like Assam, Bihar, and Tripura, where inadequate sewage treatment capacities were reported. Assam lacks the facility to treat 437.23 MLD of sewage, and Tripura has a significant gap of 73.68 MLD in sewage treatment. The matter is scheduled for the next hearing on December 13. (The Hindu) Paddy stubble management policy is approved by the Haryana cabinet The ""Haryana Ex-Situ Management of Paddy Straw Policy-2023"" has been approved by the Haryana cabinet to address the burning of crop residue by 2027. The policy emphasises utilising paddy straw for sustainable energy, luring in private capital, and forging close ties between farmers and industry. It dissuades harmful burning and provides a number of incentives to encourage the use of paddy straw. The goal of the policy is to improve air quality, soil health, and employment opportunities, and it is consistent with the government's commitment to harness energy from paddy straw. Under the Haryana Bio-energy Policy-2018, which covers biomass-based power projects, biogas plants, ethanol production, and other biofuel initiatives, projects using paddy straw as a primary feed material are eligible for incentives. For the management of paddy straw, farmers and organisations have access to subsidies on agricultural equipment. Interest on term loans will be subsidised for industries that use paddy straw. It will be possible to better coordinate demand and supply thanks to the establishment of an online linkage system between farmers, industries, and end users. The department of new and renewable energy will coordinate the district-level mapping of paddy straw demand. MSMEs, such as the paper and brick industries, will profit from financial incentives for the adoption of biofuels. Projects based on paddy straw are eligible for incentives under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare's Central Sector Scheme. According to guidelines from the Union ministry, all thermal power plants in Haryana will implement biomass co-firing, obtaining local biomass through an online system set up by the agriculture department. In cooperation with other relevant departments, the department of new and renewable energy will take the lead on policy implementation.

This introduction represents a substantial stride in augmenting the efficiency and outreach of the PM-KISAN initiative, aiming to provide farmers with swift, lucid, and precise responses to their inquiries. Kailash Choudhary, Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, emphasized that the AI chatbot aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to revolutionize farmers' lives and enhance governance through technology. The chatbot, according to Choudhary, will facilitate access to scheme information and grievance resolution, with plans to expand its services to encompass weather updates, soil conditions, and bank payments. During the virtual launch event attended by officials from the Government of India and state governments, Manoj Ahuja, Secretary of the Department of Agriculture & Family Welfare, announced plans to implement the AI chatbot for other major schemes of the Ministry in the coming months. Pramod Mehreda, Additional Secretary, provided an in-depth presentation on the chatbot's features and benefits for farmers. The AI chatbot, integrated into the PM-KISAN grievance management system, acts as a comprehensive guide for beneficiaries. Developed with support from the EKstep Foundation and Bhashini, it is the first of its kind integrated with a major flagship government scheme. In its initial phase, the chatbot will assist farmers in obtaining information related to application status, payment details, ineligibility status, and other scheme-related updates through the PM-KISAN mobile app. Presently available in English, Hindi, Bengali, Odia, and Tamil, the chatbot is expected to support all 22 languages of the country soon. The PM-KISAN scheme, initiated in February 2019, provides an annual financial benefit of Rs 6,000 to eligible farmers' families through the Direct Benefit Transfer mode. With over Rs. 2.61 lakhs crores disbursed to over 11 crore farmers since its inception, the scheme has significantly contributed to the socio-economic well-being of small landholding farmer families across the nation. The introduction of a mobile app with face authentication-based e-KYC further enhances accessibility for farmers, even in remote areas. (Agriculture Post) Karnataka appeals to Cauvery Panel for reconsideration, contemplates Supreme Court appeal On Saturday, the Karnataka government submitted a review petition to the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) challenging the directive to release 3,000 cusecs of water daily until October 15. Additionally, the government sought approval for the construction of a balancing reservoir near Kanakapura in the Ramanagara district. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah asserted that the state would approach the Supreme Court if necessary, expressing discontent with the CWMA's decision. Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar, who oversees the water resources portfolio, emphasized the urgent need for a ""new formula"" in light of the deficient rainfall experienced from June to August, exacerbating the severe water scarcity in the state. Siddaramaiah convened a meeting with retired Supreme Court judges and former advocates general on Friday to gather insights before deciding on the review"
1039,Agriculture,"India recognises the risks associated with climate change and incorporates them into policies through initiatives at the national and state levels. Climate smart agriculture is supported by the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), with initiatives centered on improving soil health, crop diversification, integrated farming, and reducing methane emissions. However, there are issues with inadequate interdepartmental coordination and a narrow focus on small farmers.Important programs are the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which provides crop insurance, and the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, which manages water resources. Despite government initiatives, gender disparities in the agriculture sector still exist. Adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices is confronted with obstacles pertaining to decision-making authority, market and credit facilities, risk-taking inclinations, resource control, and technology access. Due to lower literacy, restricted mobility, and financial constraints, gender gaps make adoption more difficult for women."
1040,Skilling,"India has over 2,50,000 Gram Panchayats, which manage the governance of over 6,64,000 villages spread across the country. The institutions of self-governance - Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) were given constitutional status through the 73rd Amendment. This was done to empower communities to participate in the local development process driven by local needs. Several functions are entrusted to the PRIs, including, agriculture and allied sectors, land improvement, minor irrigation, forestry, drinking water, sanitation, and health. While the Constitution provides processes and mechanisms to strengthen local governance, there continue to be gaps in the capacities of “doers” who leverage the available resources to drive the development. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has had several programs in the past such as the Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyaan (RGPSA) to strengthen PRIs and address the critical gaps that constrain their functioning. Other programs of State and Central government which are centered on community participation have also attempted to build capacities of PRI functionaries and community leaders for their meaningful participation in programs. Some programs of government and NGOs are attempting to solve these issues with the aid of technology. One such program is the Odisha Livelihoods Mission (OLM), which has partnered with the Foundation for Ecological Security, a non-profit working towards ecological restoration to build capacities of its Krishi Mitra cadre at scale using digital content and periodic virtual interactions that ensure unfettered knowledge access, peer-to-peer learning, timely resolution of queries, and footprinting of trainees through digital attestations. Hindustan Unilever Foundation and Arghyam are supporting some of these efforts. One of the participants of this learning journey is Kalyani Dash, a 28-year old frontline worker, who has been working as a Krishi Mitra for the last three years in Koroda village of Nayagarh district in Odisha. She was one of the members of an SHG promoted by OLM when she applied for the Krishi Mitra role with an aspiration to work for the community while building her own career as a trained community resource person. Currently, she works with 150 households in the village directly and trains them on chemical-free farming techniques, water secure crop production, efficient water use in agriculture for a sustainable farming future as well as kitchen and nutrition gardening to ensure a regular healthy diet for the community. To gain the community’s trust has not been quick and easy. When she started on this journey, it was normal for her to hear comments like “What can an inexperienced novice girl teach us that we already do not know?” - especially from older male farmers. When she shared these experiences with her peers from other villages in group meetings, other Krishi Mitras also shared similar challenges. The group members motivated one another so that they could keep going. “We never lost hope and we stayed the course,"" she says. She underwent several training sessions in the last few years on topics including sustainable agriculture, digital-enabled data collection, nutrient management, organic farming, integrated pest and disease management, use of digital tools, crop"
1041,Skilling,"Every year, programs of central and state governments and donor-supported programs train thousands of people who work to implement programs on water and sanitation in their villages. These “first-mile” actors are known by several names depending on the programs they are associated with. Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) alone has 6.9 lakh Swachhagrahis in the program, of which 4.9 lakh are paid under the program i.e. the skills and knowledge they have acquired to work on sanitation has resulted in a livelihood opportunity for them. Similarly, the ongoing Atal Bhujal Yojana plans to train Bhujal Jankaars (para hydrogeologists) across over 9000 Gram Panchayats on the science of groundwater and ways to ensure local water security. Parallelly, Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) is working with its own cadre on the ground to prepare village action plans, which require knowledge of sanitation (greywater management) as well as groundwater (source sustainability). JJM has also been training masons, electricians, and plumbers to install and maintain pipeline infrastructure and some states plan to reuse them in other programs by maintaining their details in a database. In this article, we explore the need to recognize these actors in the water sector for the skills they have acquired. We emphasize the urgency to create a database of such skilled persons and engage them in future programs or on a long-term basis through different engagement models so that sustainable livelihoods can be generated for them while they work to provide water and sanitation services to their communities. The article is based on our conversation with two well-known experts in the water and livelihoods sectors: Dr Tushaar Shah and Mr Ved Arya. 1. Does every village need skilled people for water management? There are four distinct lines of work that require skilled human resources in villages: Water resource management at river basin level or watershed level including rainwater harvesting and storage for supply augmentation; Groundwater management, especially in areas with overexploited aquifers; Infrastructure management such as pipeline and canal maintenance; Service delivery i.e. the distribution of water to users for multiple uses and quality monitoring. Some of these activities are at an individual level, such as water distribution through a piped network, irrigation services etc., whereas others such as groundwater management require the lens of common-pool resource management. More than one-third of the country’s population lives in groundwater-stressed areas and millions are vulnerable to health issues resulting from drinking contaminated water. Hence, the question no longer is if there is a need, but rather how do we address this need. 2. How has the role of a village water professional (entrepreneur/ manager) evolved in the last few decades? And where are we headed from here? The water economy is evolving rapidly. Around 60 years ago, tanks played a critical role in village water security, especially in peninsular India. Rural water entrepreneurs and distribution operators, known by several names (Neerkatti, Neeranikkan, Neerganti, Kambukatti etc.), played an active role in ensuring effective water distribution for irrigation. But today, with most irrigation systems dominated"
1042,Skilling,"For decades, governments, philanthropies, CSRs and CSOs have been exploring ways to ensure water security for both lifeline activities and livelihoods. Most of these programs have focussed their efforts on creating water infrastructure (canals, pipelines, tanks, etc.) and delivery of water services to communities or households (distribution networks, filters and RO plants). Several also focus on managing water resources- both surface and groundwater (watershed, GW recharge, rainwater harvesting, desilting, etc.). Central to the success of these programs, irrespective of their outcomes, are the people who actually perform the work on the ground, the frontline workers - who are from the “first-mile” - the community. The roles and responsibilities of these frontline workers can vary depending on the program objectives. For instance, it could be that of a mason or a plumber who lays pipelines or maintains them; it could be that of a community resource person whose job it is to mobilize communities; a para-hydrogeologist (Bhujal Jankaars) who creates water security plans and updates them periodically; an elected member of the Gram Panchayat who procures necessary funds, gets consensus on a plan and ensures quality implementation of the plan; a water operator who ensures safe water is consistently delivered and water-user fees is collected and so on. Motivation beyond compensation but to what end? These frontline workers get trained and acquire invaluable skills in the process of fulfilling their roles within one or multiple programs. The compensation for their work varies based on the program. For e.g. the Swachh Bharat Mission has registered all the Swachhagrahis and compensated 65% of them. The remaining 35% are expected to work as volunteers. Across programs, however, these people often do not have well defined roles. They are not recognized and hence there is barely any funding available to engage them. Even flagship programs like Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) and Atal Bhujal Yojana (AJY) which emphasise community participation do not define the role of the frontline workers. The guidelines seem to stop at CSO involvement and building village institutions. The frontline workers - are a must/ great to have but it is unclear how they can be compensated for their efforts. How fair is it for programs with thousands of crores funding to expect the services of these frontline workers on a voluntary basis? Given that most of them are trained during the program and are involved in mobilizing communities, performing activities, solving problems, contextualizing and tailoring solutions to the local conditions, shouldn’t they also be compensated adequately for their time, effort, work, knowledge and skills? Starting afresh every time cannot result in water security In the absence of recognized water professionals who have defined roles and remuneration, villages quickly fall back to the problems that they faced before a program intervention. And another day, another program comes in and starts afresh. Can this paradigm be changed?"
1043,Skilling,"Whether it is lifeline water or livelihood water, managing the resource to ensure prevention of overexploitation, equitable distribution, maintenance of infrastructure, ensuring a safety stock or reserve for periods of dry spells, etc. needs to be done by someone in every Gram Panchayat on a regular basis. We need to first recognize that, just like teachers in education or Asha workers in health, it takes skilled people in every gram panchayat to create, manage and sustain water resources and infrastructure and provide service delivery on an ongoing basis. Can we look at innovative models for engagement which can provide answers to whether these funds come from the market or from the state? Estimating the resource requirement to engage a water professional cadre We made an attempt at some back-of-the-envelope calculations to understand the funds required to support the water professionals Estimating the resource requirement to engage a water professional cadre We made an attempt at some back-of-the-envelope calculations to understand the funds required to support the water professionals No. of people required per GP for lifeline and livelihoods water depending on the factors like size and population of the GP, etc(Performing roles of community mobilization, technical inputs (hydrogeology), water service delivery, water quality measurement and operation & maintenance) = 2-4 Annual compensation per water professional in GP(Based on minimum wages for skilled labour in the country @ Rs. 10,000 per month)=Rs. 1,20,000/- Cost per GP per annum for maintaining the lifeline and livelihood water (Average of 3 ppl per GP X B)=Rs. 3,60,000/- Total number of Gram Panchayats in India=2,50,000 Total annual cost for 3 water workers in 2.5 lakh GPs (C*D)=Rs 9000 crores"
1044,Skilling,"While Rs. 9000 crore looks like a large amount, we submit that it is manageable: With an allocation of Rs 236,805 crores for 2021-26, the investment in the water cadre would require only about 20% of the total annual allocation from the 15th Finance Commission, which aims to catalyze effective governance at the grassroots level, received a top-up for the next 5 years. Currently, 15th FC grants cannot be utilized for salaries; there is a need to make an exception for the water frontline considering the criticality. We can also look at the metering and billing experience in urban areas where citizens pay for their water supplies. However flawed it may be in terms of the billing and collection, a certain percentage of the capital and operating expenses are partially covered by these payments. If we take the same viewpoint, high-level calculations look something like this: Number of rural households as per 2011 census= 179.1 million or 17.91 crore Assuming Rs. 100 annual contribution from 50% of the households (households that can afford)=Rs 895.5 crore % of funds fulfilled by community contribution ~ 10% Collection of funds would involve a behavioral change of the communities but with an assured and consistent supply of safe water, this should not be a herculean task. The water professionals could be tasked and incentivized for the collection of these funds. Large scale programs - funded by centre, state or privately have funds for capacity building that can be leveraged for skilling and funding the water cadre. Similarly, funds for skilled and semi-skilled labour can be leveraged under MGNREGS. 60% of the works under MGNREGS needs to be on Natural Resource Management activities and since water security is a critical issue, leveraging these funds for engaging water professional will help in better utilization as well as ensuring sustainability of the water management activities taken up under the program.Now is the time to act It is evident that there is money available. Whether it is through the 15th Finance Commission grants or community contribution or a mix of other funding sources (donors, market, funding from other government departments), there are thousands of crores being allocated for water management. And, a small fraction of the funding can be apportioned to engage and develop a skilled water cadre across the country. The urgency and need for creating this water cadre cannot be denied. These people need to be trained, skilled, recognized, and compensated while being held accountable for the work they do. Several states like Maharashtra (Jal Surakshaks), Karnataka (Jalagaras), Bihar (Anurakshaks), etc have acknowledged the need and are engaging local communities in water management. But more needs to be done in upgrading their skill-sets and making them central to achieving water security. We have the opportunity to tackle the impending water crisis, locally, leaving the power to continue to contextualise and manage the resource within each Gram Panchayat. This is an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss."
1045,Skilling,"Samerth has been working since 2000 on providing safe water to the marginalised communities in the remote areas of Rapar and Bhachau blocks of Kutch district in Gujarat. This is a drought-prone area surrounded by big and small Rann (desert) with an unpredictable monsoon. Groundwater being scarce, there is a pronounced dependence on surface water. When Samerth began working on water issues, it observed how a single poor monsoon would result in a mass exodus from the villages as there would be an immediate shortage of water for drinking, cattle, agriculture etc. Samerth started working with local communities to build their capacities on basic geohydrology, incorporating traditional wisdom, preparation of a water budget and finally a water security plan (WSP) of the village. This plan would be authenticated in the gram sabha and a resolution to implement it through its finances passed by the panchayat. This helped involve and in some instances activate panchayat bodies such as the Village Water and Sanitation Committee. Women were involved in the process of developing the water budget from a gender lens. The Talati (revenue officer), water board officials of the block, as well as the most marginalised people, were brought together for the planning. A cadre of individuals from the community - Jaldoots in local parlance has been developed to achieve a better impact. Samerth has trained more than 40 men and women as Jaldoots who have made great inroads in the last 4 years. This meant equipping them with an understanding of modern technology and its uses, such as - global positioning systems (GPS), different Applications (Apps) and lastly online interactions, which became a norm during the pandemic. Most Jaldoots had never used a smartphone and thus the training began from basic technology and then moved on to higher skills and knowledge. Now the group of Jaldoots are also into making films and short videos."
1046,Skilling,"Initiatives by the government The Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABhY) and Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) are a step in the right direction with community participation as its core. The Applications developed by the government for data collection and collation make these a technically sound program. At the time of writing this article, we found gaps in training and understanding on the ground on the data (primary vs. secondary, verifiable sources etc). The data collected through these Apps should be made accessible to all so that constant reinvention of the wheel can be avoided. Currently, data is collected by many sources but due to the lack of an authentic source, there is a wide discrepancy. Self-sustainable model - a farfetched dream or reality in near future? Expertise in water management is much needed in a region like Kutch where we are continuously facing water shortage. The poorest people who are heavily caught up in their struggle for survival invariably face a shortage. Planning or visioning on anything – including water is not an immediate priority. It is here that civil society organisations can create an environment where such services become a priority. Samerth envisions a water resource centre at cluster level across India providing demand-based services on water testing, soil testing, water budgeting, support and advice on optimum methods for water harvesting and other technical services for water conservation and governance. Training has been provided to Talati of Rapar block of Kutch district on the preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) as per government norms. Ensuring community participation and active involvement in developing GPDP and perspective plans has been a priority. The entire bottom-up approach of developing GPDPs in panchayats with the community’s active participation has enabled the members of marginalised groups to voice their needs. Community provided inputs during the preparation of the WSPs and GPDPs of 97 villages of Rapar block facilitated by Samerth. Kutch is a semi-arid region surrounded by the Greater Rann of Kutch and the Arabian sea. Rapar block where Samerth has been working for 20 years faces challenges in water management. It lies near the small and Greater Rann of Kutch and its groundwater is saline. For its drinking and irrigation purposes, the community mostly depends upon the surface water sources such as ponds. Management of these surface water bodies through the local institutions, which can govern the distribution of water becomes very crucial. These institutions also frae the rules for the sustainable, equitous and judicious use of water by the community. In absence of the local institutions, these water bodies were being over-exploited by the dominant sections (castes) of the community. The existing layout of the villages, with their segregated arrangement, often leaves the vulnerable households behind. In Rapar and Bhachau blocks, the gram panchayats have many hamlets that are far away from the main village (8 to 10 km without proper roads). It becomes all the more difficult to get the families from these areas on board to access their basic entitlements. The"
1047,Skilling,"There is good evidence that frontline workers have proved to be gamechanger in the delivery of services like health and integrated child development services (ICDS). However, the sanitation sector was bereft of any frontline workers for ensuring effective delivery of sanitation services as till the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, there was no workforce below the block level. The gram panchayats were not linked with the district plans. There was no mechanism to measure the increase or decrease or the possibility of slip back of rural households with defunct toilets or toilets no longer in use or extinct. Thus, there was a huge gap below the block level and a demonstrated need of having someone at gram panchayat level who could talk to the communities about the benefits of sanitation and involve them in the planning and implementation of the mission. This is reflected in poor progress on sanitation till 2014, with only 39% households having access to sanitation services. What changed? Basic services demand community engagement and participation. Sanitation especially needs frontline workers as it demands work both on infrastructure and behaviour change. Behaviour change can only be accomplished if there is a frontline worker, who can support villages to build new norms. The Swachh Bharat Mission launched in the year 2014, which had an ambitious target of making the country Open Defecation Free (ODF) realized the need of bridging the gap between service providers and the community through a trained frontline worker. As per the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) guidelines, swachhagrahis are its foot soldiers and are the motivators for bringing about behaviour change concerning key sanitation practices in rural India. Every village should ideally have at least one swachhagrahi, with preference given to women candidates. A swachhagrahi is a volunteer who can belong to any background, including a local ASHA worker, ANM, Anganwadi worker, and staff, water lineman, pump operator, member of NGO/CSOs, youth organisations or any community member from the villages to work on a community approach to sanitation as there was a demonstrated need of having frontline workers who could trigger action within the communities. The country witnessed how sanitation programs success rests on the social behaviour change through the Swachh Bharat Mission! The role of swachhagrahis is one of the key factors in achieving the ODF status and sustaining it through post-ODF activities. They are the frontline workers of the Swachh Bharat Mission and the key pillars of interpersonal communication at the community level. How? The kind of communication expected during interpersonal communications and door to door visits called for intensive training of swachhagrahis. So, there was a need to build the capacity of the swacchagrahis to equip them to not only communicate effectively but also be available with answers to questions related to the toilet technology, incentives from the government etc. The swachhagrahis also had to be enabled with a variety of communication tools to motivate the community members to construct and use toilets. The swacchagrahis do require ready content to speak and encourage dialogue"
1048,Skilling,"Groundwater levels across India have been falling rapidly, affecting the livelihood and wellbeing of village communities. Top-down approaches to groundwater management have not worked. The MARVI project, ‘Managing Aquifer Recharge and Sustaining Groundwater Use through Village-level Intervention’, was a village-level participatory approach for measuring groundwater levels and improving groundwater productivity. The MARVI team led trans-disciplinary research on sustainable groundwater management in India. Nine organisations from three countries, 35 researchers and 36 farmer researchers worked together to improve the groundwater situation. The project has developed a participatory approach, models and tools that can effectively work for villagers to monitor groundwater and rainfall. Villagers can also plan for sustainable groundwater use through village groundwater cooperatives. The approach is ready to extend and adapt beyond the study watersheds. Introduction More than half of India is undergoing serious water stress and the situation is expected to worsen in the future. In rural communities, reduced availability of groundwater constrains food production, jeopardises farm incomes, catalyses increased urban migration, and fractures community cohesion and harmony. The management of groundwater has become quite complex due to a range of actors involved in its development and use. MARVI—Managing Aquifer Recharge and Sustaining Groundwater Use through Village-level Intervention - was a collaborative project between India and Australia. It aimed to improve cooperative decision-making for sustainable groundwater use. This required developing a village-level participatory approach to measure groundwater levels, rainfall, water quality and check-dam water levels, and improve water use efficiency. A total of eight organisations were involved in the MARVI project with Western Sydney University leading the project. The other partners were (i) CSIRO Land & Water; (ii) International Water Management Institute; (iii) Arid Communities & Technologies; (iv) Development Support Centre; (v) Maharana Pratap University of Agriculture and Technology; (vi) Vidya Bhawan Krishi Vigyan Kendra; and (vii) Mekong Futures Research Institute. The MARVI approach The MARVI project was carried out in two watersheds in India with hard-rock aquifers, one in Rajasthan and the other one in Gujarat. In total, 11 villages were involved. The main activities in MARVI included creating awareness about the extent of the groundwater problem; capacity building of the local people to monitor, quantify and manage groundwater resources; and piloting village groundwater cooperatives. A unique feature of MARVI was the development of Bhujal Jaankaars (BJs), a Hindi word meaning ‘groundwater informed’. These are volunteers who went through training and capacity building to monitor rainfall, groundwater levels and quality, and water levels in check dams, and who worked as local champions. BJs monitored water table fluctuations in 350 dug wells weekly for more than five years. They also monitored rainfall and water levels in check dams. The monitoring was the basis for the first comprehensive water database at the village level. The project also developed the MyWell app (currently available only on the Android platform but it will soon be available on iOS platform as well) for volunteers to use to record water data and make them widely available to improve understanding of the groundwater situation.
